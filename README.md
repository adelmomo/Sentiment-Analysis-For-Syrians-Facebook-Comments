# Sentiment Analysis For Syrians Facebook Comments
One of the major applications in Natural Language Processing (NLP) is Sentiment Analysis. Sentiment Analysis plays an important role in social networks, Sentiment Analysis studies the opinions of people about an event, a new disease such as COVID-19...etc, or in general. This project provides 2 deep learning models based on Long Short Term (LSTM) recurrent neural network, Word Embedding, and Naive Bayes theory. Each of the 2 models has a classification accuracy on the Syrians Facebook comments dataset. The first model "Embedding" is based only on LSTM and Word Embedding where the word vectors of a sentence are features to the LSTM model, the second model is based on Naive Bayes, LSTM, and Word Embedding where the probability of a word being in a positive sentence, negative sentence, or neutral and the Word Embedding vectors became the features to the LSTM model.
